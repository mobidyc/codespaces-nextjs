/*
Create a basic markdown editor in Next.js with the following features:
- Use React hooks
- Create state for markdown with the default text "## markdown preview"
- Create a variable initial_text with the content: this is the original text
- A read only text area using 45% of the page width on the left with the content text from the variable initial_text
- A text area using 45% of the page width on the right where users can write markdown 
- Show a live preview of the markdown text as I type
- Support for basic markdown syntax like headers, bold, italics 
- Use React markdown npm package 
- The markdown text and resulting HTML should be saved in the component's state and updated in real time
